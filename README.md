FastText has also published a fast and accurate tool for text-based language identification capable of reognizing more than 170 languages. The tool has been open-sourced to be used for free by anyone. To versions of language identification are available, each optimized for different memory usage.

lid.176.bin, which is faster and slightly more accurate, but has a file size of 126MB.
lid.176.ftz, which is the compressed version of the model, with a file size of 917kB. The smaller file size is achieved by a little compromise on accuracy
